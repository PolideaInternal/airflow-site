.. py:class:: MLEngineHook

   Bases: :class:`airflow.gcp.hooks.base.GoogleCloudBaseHook`

   Hook for Google ML Engine APIs.

   All the methods in the hook where project_id is used must be called with
   keyword arguments rather than positional.

   
   .. method:: get_conn(self)

      Retrieves the connection to MLEngine.

      :return: Google MLEngine services object.



   
   .. method:: create_job(self, job:Dict, project_id:Optional[str]=None, use_existing_job_fn:Optional[Callable]=None)

      Launches a MLEngine job and wait for it to reach a terminal state.

      :param project_id: The Google Cloud project id within which MLEngine
          job will be launched. If set to None or missing, the default project_id from the GCP
          connection is used.
      :type project_id: str
      :param job: MLEngine Job object that should be provided to the MLEngine
          API, such as: ::

              {
                'jobId': 'my_job_id',
                'trainingInput': {
                  'scaleTier': 'STANDARD_1',
                  ...
                }
              }

      :type job: dict
      :param use_existing_job_fn: In case that a MLEngine job with the same
          job_id already exist, this method (if provided) will decide whether
          we should use this existing job, continue waiting for it to finish
          and returning the job object. It should accepts a MLEngine job
          object, and returns a boolean value indicating whether it is OK to
          reuse the existing job. If 'use_existing_job_fn' is not provided,
          we by default reuse the existing MLEngine job.
      :type use_existing_job_fn: function
      :return: The MLEngine job object if the job successfully reach a
          terminal state (which might be FAILED or CANCELLED state).
      :rtype: dict



   
   .. method:: _get_job(self, project_id:str, job_id:str)

      Gets a MLEngine job based on the job id.

      :param project_id: The project in which the Job is located.

      :type project_id: str

      :type job_id: str
      :return: MLEngine job object if succeed.

   .. method:: _wait_for_job_done(self, project_id:str, job_id:str, interval:int=30)

      Waits for the Job to reach a terminal state.

      This method will periodically check the job state until the job reach
      a terminal state.
